## Design Choices üé®
The theme of this project is a website portfolio, So I chose a geometric image fixed on the background, it has green geometric forms with a dark background that reminds me of the movie **The Matrix**, with that rain falling down green characters and pictograms the "Matrix code".

#### Fonts:
I chose to use the font **[Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono)** because I saw it in a site of a company that teach people to code and I found it amazing. It looks like lines of code.üë®‚Äçüíª

#### Icons:
I used four icons in the about section to illustrate the ways that I delivery my websites which are: fast, intuitive, responsive and dynamic, also I used to icons in the footer that lead the user to GitHub and LinkedIn. The icons are from font-awesome.

#### Colors:
Based in a colors research and using this knowledge was figured out the power of the colors. Color affects your moods, behavior, and thoughts. Your reactions to colors are often deeply personal and rooted in your own experiences. The right combination of colors can increase sales/clients.

- Primary: #01FB01 **'Electric Green'** I chose this colors as a primary color because one of the most positive aspects of green is its reference to inspiration, growth, freshness, safety and hope.
- Secondary: #343A40 **'Gunmetal'** This color was chosen because it contrasts with the background image and it matches with the primary color.
- Tertiary: #E9ECEF **'Cultured'** This is a standard color for Jumbotron and almost all sections have this color as a background.
- Progress bar: #FFC107 **'Mikado Yellow'** I chose this kind of yellow in the progress bar where I show the percentage of my skills in each area.

#### Background:
The image that I chose to use fixed in the background of the website is from [FreePik](https://www.freepik.com/). I manually resized the image using a tool called [PhotoPea](https://www.photopea.com/), having accurately sized images reduces the load time of the website.

## Wireframes: üîß
For this project, I created wireframes using [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.cloud/) and [Proto Prototypes](https://proto.io/). I started by creating some basics wireframes for desktop/mobile on Balsamiq just to have an idea. After that, I built a prototype with more styling.

## Planning: üìê
As this was my first project I followed the wireframes that I had created, thanks to the layout being organised in the wireframes I was able to select what feature to work on, organise how I was going to approach each section and follow my testing guide to check that it had been implemented correctly and works as expected. In future projects I would look to include more automated testing to help me with my tests.

## Testing: üîå
#### Testing Stories:
* I realised that the colours I had chose clashed too much in terms of contrast, I then used coolors.co to select a new color scheme and implemented the new colours.
* I added some inline style in my index.html, then I moved all styles to style.css.
* I was informed that the owner's website would like to show his abilitilies, I then created a progress bar with the technologies that he knows.
* I Initially used "pixels" as unit of measurement then I was Informed that "rem" is the right one then I changed the units. 

### Overall:

<strong>Responsiveness - </strong>
* <strong>Plan</strong> üìù: I knew that this project needed to be FULLY responsive and mobile friendly therefore the obvious option to use Bootstrap as this HTML Framework I'm most comfortable using. Testing using dev-tools throughout and also a final test of the entire site after completion.
* <strong>Implementation</strong> üè≠: Throughout writing my HTML code making sure to use appropriate bootstrap class modifiers to provide correct breakpoints for the content. Testing breakpoints was relatively simple thanks to the easy to use Bootstrap, i only really modified a few breakpoints after writing the majority of my HTML.
* <strong>Result</strong> üèÜ: The Responsiveness of the site works as expected, no elements or content escape their boundaries or are hard to see on any device.
* <strong>Verdict</strong> ‚úÖ: This test has passed and therefore the site is responsive.
