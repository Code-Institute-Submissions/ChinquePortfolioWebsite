## Design Choices üé®
The theme of this project is a website portfolio, So I chose a geometric image fixed on the background, it has green geometric forms with a dark background that remainds me of the movie **The Matrix**, with that rain falling down green characters and pictograms the "Matrix code".

#### Fonts:
I chose to use the font **Space Mono** because I saw it in a site of a company that teach people to code and I found it amazing. It looks like lines of code.üë®‚Äçüíª

#### Icons:
I used four icons in the about section to illustrate the ways that I delivery my websites which are: fast, intuitive, responsive and dynamic, also I used to icons in the footer that lead the user to GitHub and LinkedIn. The icons are from font-awesome.

#### Colors:
Based in a colors research and using this knowledge was figured out the power of the colors. Color affects your moods, behavior, and thoughts. Your reactions to colors are often deeply personal and rooted in your own experiences. The right combination of colors can increase sales/clients.

- Primary: #01FB01 **'Vibrant Green'** I chose this colors as a primary color because one of the most positive aspects of green is its reference to inspiration, growth, freshness, safety and hope.
- Secondary: #343A40 **'Dark Grey'** This color was chosen because it contrasts with the background image and it matches with the primary color.
- Tertiary: #E9ECEF **'Light Grey'** This is a standard color for Jumbotron and almost all sections have this color as a background.
- Progress bar: #FFC107 **'Gold'** I chose this kind of yellow in the progress bar where I show the percentage of my skills in each area.

#### Background:
The image that I chose to use fixed in the background of the website is from [FreePik](https://www.freepik.com/). I manually resized the image using a tool called [PhotoPea](https://www.photopea.com/), having accurately sized images reduces the load time of the website.

## Wireframes: üîß
For this project I created wireframes using [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.cloud/) and [Proto Prototypes](https://proto.io/). I started by creating some basics wireframes for desktop/mobile on Balsamiq just to have an idea. After that I built a prototype with more styling.
